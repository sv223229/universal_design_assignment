                <abbr title="Buy now pay later">BNPL</abbr>
                <P> “Buy now, pay later,” or BNPL, is a type of installment loan. It divides your purchase into multiple equal payments, with the first payment due at checkout. The remaining payments are billed to your debit, credit card or bank account until your purchase is paid in full.
BNPL plans don’t usually charge interest, though some may charge fees, depending on the provider. There’s also no hard credit check to get approved, unlike a credit card or loan. 
These features have made BNPL a popular payment option for consumers.<mark> More than half of Americans (55%) </mark> say they’ve used buy now, pay later services, according to a NerdWallet survey conducted online by The Harris Poll. </P>

            </h2>
            <strong>Warning!</strong> <i>There are several downsides to consider before signing up. </i>            
              <p><b>Overspending</b></p>
              <p><em>The interest-free installments and smaller payment amounts can make larger purchases seem more affordable than they really are. This can lead to a temptation to buy more stuff than needed, increasing the risk of debt, defaulted payments, and lower credit scores.</em></p>
              <p><b>Limited Regulations</b></p>
              <p><em>BNPL services are generally not as regulated as credit cards and other forms of financing in the U.S., which means consumers don’t get strong protection and dispute resolution options.</em></p>
              <p><b>Issues with Returns and Refunds</b></p>
              <p><em>As BNPL services spread the payment amount over time, it can be difficult to cancel the payment or issue a refund in case of returns.</em></p>
              <p><b>Risks of Late Payments</b></p>
              <p><em>Some BNPL providers charge additional fees in case of late payments. Any defaults are also reported to the credit bureaus, which lowers the credit score, making it difficult to access other forms of financing.</em></p>

                <P>Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) offers short-term loans that split expensive purchases into smaller, interest-free payments.</P>
                <p>BNPL loans can be more affordable than other forms of financing, but they are less secure. </p>
