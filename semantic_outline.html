                <h2> COSTCO GLIZZY</h2>
                <p>The Costco hot dog is a 1‚ÅÑ4-pound (110-gram) hot dog sold at the international warehouse club Costco's food courts. It is notable for its steady price and cult following as a combo deal with a soda at North American locations since its introduction in 1984.</p>
                <p> The Costco hot dog was introduced to food courts in 1984,[1] one year after Costco's opening in 1983.[2] The original hot dog was made by Hebrew National,[3] and was sold at a hot dog cart outside a Costco location in San Diego. As of 2018, Costco sold a yearly average of 135 million hot dogs,[4] more than every Major League Baseball stadium combined.[5] In November 2022, Sam's Club, a Costco competitor, reduced the price of its hot dog and soda combo deal to $1.38 in an attempt to compete with the Costco hot dog.</p>
